# Credit Card Encryption and Decryption

## Overview

This project securely encrypts and decrypts credit card numbers using strong cryptographic techniques. It is ideal for understanding the basics of cybersecurity, access control, and cryptography. The project also prepares you to integrate such systems with cloud platforms in real-world applications.

---

## Features

- Encrypts credit card numbers using AES (via Fernet)
- Decrypts securely with access authentication
- Access control using basic password protection
- Modular structure for easy cloud integration
- Environment variable support for secure key handling

---

## Technologies Used

- *Python 3*
- *cryptography* – for symmetric key encryption/decryption
- *python-dotenv* – for loading secret keys from .env
- (Optional) Cloud storage integration (Firebase, AWS)
